function varargout = BSGUI(varargin)
% BSGUI MATLAB code for BSGUI.fig
%      BSGUI, by itself, creates a new BSGUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = BSGUI returns the handle to a new BSGUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      BSGUI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in BSGUI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      BSGUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new BSGUI or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before BSGUI_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to BSGUI_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".

%% NOTES

% Date: 4/25/2017 after midnight

% Code that was added was added to prevent changing health stats on
% player/enemy.
% Player and enemy health is now stored in the ListboxTop of their sliders.

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
% Lines of code added to opening functions above and callbacks. 
% Last bits:
%   : Two lines added to BattleStatsF to ensure correct stats on
% slider and ListboxTop during setup. (in first couple lines)
%   : lines added to combatF to update both enemy and player health by
%   changing ListboxTop amount in addition to already changing slider value
%  (lines 69,90,121)

% Trying to add visible stats on screen and on attackList.
% Going to add code to BattleStatsF at "Set List of Attacks" so that the
% string cell array added includes the modifiers of each weapon!

% ~ Matthew Phelps

% Okay. That's done. It now shows how much damage it can possibly deal and
% how accurate it is (via accuracy modifier).

% Now I want to have player stats displayed.
